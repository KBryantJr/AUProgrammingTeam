# 100 Doors
There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
You make 100 passes by the doors.
The first time through, visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed open it; if it is open, close it).
The second time, only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6, ...) and toggle it.
The third time, visit every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9, ...)
Keep doing this until you only visit the 100th door.
Output the open doors after making all the passes

Added challenge find a pattern from the open doors that you outputted and then print the same open doors as previous but only make one pass through the array of doors (no I donâ€™t mean hard code the answer)
