# 3n Plus 1 problem

f(n) where :   if n is even n = n/2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if n is odd n = 3n + 1

Given an input n, it is possible to determine the number of numbers printed before and including
the 1 is printed.  For a given n this is called the cycle-length of n.  

Given the input 22, the following sequence of numbers will be printed
22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

In the example above, the cycle
length of 22 is 16.

The challenge is to write a progarm that when given an input n it will output the cycle count of n

For a further challenge when given a range of nubmer i-j print the max cycle count from this range of numbers including i and j
